We used python language and what library we used are matplotlib, numpy, ipython, and scipy
What kinds of methods we used in this application?
We used Interval Bisection, Linier Interpolation, Newton-Raphson, Secant, and Iteration for 2nd Module's Methods
At the 3rd Module we used Gauss, Gauss-Jordan, Jacobi, and Gauss-Seidel for the methods
At the 4th Module we used Trapezoidal, Simpson 1/3 and 3/8 for the methods
